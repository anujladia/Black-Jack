** Black Jack **

JavaScript application using fundademtals of JS.
This should be the first application you should try building while learning Java Script.

This is for all those newbies out there trying to make something with their fundamental JavaScript knowledge.

This game just makes us play Black Jack, The card game. Just google the game if you are unaware of how the game is played. This covers most of the game features.

This is not a project after which you become a JS pro. But one which will get you going on the path of becoming one.

It does not include a lot of styling because it was just a JS project.

Pull the project and run it. Start developing the game by understanding the features you see on playing the game. Then places you get stick you can always refer to the code. But try it on your own first. 

Prerequisites:
Basic HTML, CSS, JS
Have knowledge of var, let, array, if-else, switch, functions. 
Have basic knowledge of DOM events.

Thats it. You are good to go.
